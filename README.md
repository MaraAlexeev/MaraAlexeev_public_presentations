# Mara Alexeev's Public Presentations

In December 2020, I started the process of moving all my prior public presentations to github for others to view. 

If you see an error or issue with attribution in any talk, please open an issue, and I will correct it as soon as possible. Some older talks are now deprecated and won't be updated, but for more recent talks, I hope to continue to refine them.

## Invitations

If you would like to invite me to give a talk, please open an issue on github and label it as an invitation. I require a minimal show of effort to respond, thus the labeling. :sunglasses:

I am happy to talk in the following languages: 

- English -- full lecture and all questions
- Russian -- full lecture and questions responded to in English or Russian depending on how complicated
- German -- not yet!

If you want the talk in another language, I am happy to work with someone to translate or interpret the material into the target language.
