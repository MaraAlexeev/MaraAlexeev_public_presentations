# Mara Alexeev's Public Materials

In December 2020, I started the process of moving all my prior public presentations and materials to github for others to view. 

Unfortunately, not all my work can be made public because of of privacy issues, or if I don't have permission from all my other collaborators. If you are interested in materials not publicly available here, please let me know on the issues page with the **not public** label.

If you see an error or issue with attribution in any talk, please open an issue, and I will correct it as soon as possible. Some older talks are now deprecated and won't be updated, but for more recent talks, I hope to continue to refine them.

## Invitations

If you would like to invite me to give a talk, please open an issue on github and label it as an invitation. I require a minimal show of effort to respond, thus the labeling. :sunglasses:

I am happy to talk in the following languages: 

- English -- full lecture and all questions
- Russian -- full lecture and questions responded to in English or Russian depending on how complicated
- German -- not yet!

If you want the talk in another language, I am happy to work with someone to translate or interpret the material into the target language.
